# Escape the Forest by Kaya Gaertner and Hanna Algedri
This is our Project for the Advanced Experiment Design in Unity Seminar in the Summerterm of 2021. 

You are in Forest. It is getting dark and you want to go to the Pub with your friends. 
The Pub is on the otherside and to reach it you have to go through the Forest. 
A lot of people have already died on this missions and their Skeletons are following you. 
Be aware and fast!
As a benefit you can collect Coins on your way to be able to pay for your beers.  

SO RUN!
